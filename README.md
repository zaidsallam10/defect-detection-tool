# defect-detection-tool
This is a tool to find if the code contains defect(failure/bug/fault) based on some criteria and features.


## Training data:
 1. CM1
 2. KC1


# Algorithms:
1. Decision tree 
2. Artificial neural network 
3. Hyprid model (DT-NN): training the decision tree and take the important features and inject them into the neural network (combined model)


#Accuracies on testing set:
- DT: ~83%
- NN: ~91%
- Hyprid model: ~93.60%
